Pi pin assignments

There exist logic level shifters on pins that re not listed as they have not been assigned use cases.
7 of these outputs are wired such that they can also be used as inputs. Audio reserved pins are used in
the groups of 12/13 or 18/19, the pins of the unused group are available to be used. Audio groups are 
seleted using jumpers on the board.
